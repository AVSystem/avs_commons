 *
 * If <c>AVS_LOG_WITH_TRACE</c> is defined at time of inclusion of this header,

 *
 * <code>
 * char buf[...]; // a buffer with alignment sufficient for any known data type
 * size_t buf_size;
 *

 *
 * NOTE: @p OutHandle is an optional parameter where job handle will be stored
 * during the time it remains a scheduled job. At the time of this call,

 * handle to some job scheduled on the same scheduler. In the latter case, the
 * previously scheduled job will be unscheduled and the new job will replace it.
 * Failing to ensure the above preconditions will result in undefined behaviour.
 * When the job is fetched for execution, the scheduler sets <c>*OutHandle</c>
 * to <c>NULL</c>, indicating that it is no longer a valid job handle.
 * Therefore, one has to carefully manage @p OutHandle lifetime or otherwise the
 * behaviour will be undefined.
 *
 * @returns
 * - 0 on success
 * - negative value on one of the following failure conditions:
 *   - @p Clb is <c>NULL</c>
