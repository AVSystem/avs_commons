/**
 * Creates a new HTTP stream, which may be used to perform a series of related

 *
 * The stream may reconnect if necessary, it may even change the target location
 * if an HTTP 3xx status code is received - but from the user standpoint, it can
 * be seen as a single conversation with a single server.
 *
 * <c>avs_stream_t</c> methods are implemented as follows:
 *
 * - <c>avs_stream_write_some</c> - appends some data to the request content,
 *   possibly compressing it on the fly according to the <c>encoding</c>
 *   specified.
 *
 * - <c>avs_stream_finish_message</c> - performs the HTTP request, with content
 *   formed from preceding writes, and possibly custom headers specified via
 *   @ref avs_http_add_header. Puts the stream in receiving state afterwards.
 *
 * - <c>avs_stream_read</c> - reads from the content of the response sent by the
 *   server, decompressing it on the fly if possible and applicable. At the end
 *   of the response, <c>message_finished</c> is set to true and the stream is
 *   put in sending state afterwards.
 *
 * - <c>avs_stream_peek</c> - peeks a byte from the content of the response
 *   without consuming it. The possible peek range varies depending on content
 *   and transfer encodings used by the server, but will be the value of the
 *   <c>body_recv</c> field of the @ref avs_http_buffer_sizes_t structure (4 KiB
 *   by default), decreased by chunked encoding header line length if used, for
 *   uncompressed response bodies, and in the order of the
 *   <c>content_coding_min_input</c> field from the same structure (128 bytes by
 *   default) for compressed bodies.
 *
 * - <c>avs_stream_reset</c> - puts the stream in sending mode, allowing to send
 *   a new request. If there is buffered data to send, it is discarded. If there
 *   is unread response content data, it is read to end and discarded. In some
 *   cases (e.g. aborting a request with chunked encoding), a reconnection of
 *   the communication socket may be ordered. The actual reconnect will take
 *   place when there is data to send.
 *
 *   Note that <c>avs_stream_reset()</c> does NOT reset the authentication
 *   state, so for example, if there was any response requesting the Digest
 *   authentication during the lifetime of this stream, appropriate
 *   Authorization header will be sent even after resetting the stream.
 *
 * The stream also supports the "net" extension (<c>avs_stream_net_getsock()</c>
 * and <c>avs_stream_net_setsock()</c>).
 *
 * The stream is initially created in sending state. Even for GET requests
 * without any content, it is necessary to call
 * <c>avs_stream_finish_message()</c> to actually send the request. This makes
 * it possible to pass any custom headers via @ref avs_http_add_header
 * beforehand. Mixing read and write calls without paying attention to the state
 * transitions as described above is undefined behaviour.
 *
 * All requests that fit within a single buffer of size configured by the
 * <c>body_send</c> field of the @ref avs_http_buffer_sizes_t (4 KiB by
 * default), are sent directly using the default transfer encoding and the
 * Content-Length header. Larger requests are automatically split and sent using
 * chunked encoding.
 *
 * If authentication credentials are specified, they are automatically sent
 * using the Basic scheme if HTTPS encryption is used. For plain unencrypted
 * HTTP, they are not sent by default, but only if the server requests them
 * using the 401 Unauthorized status code.
 *
 * @param out           Pointer to the target variable to store the created
 *                      stream in. It is expected that <c>*out</c> is initially
 *                      <c>NULL</c>.
 *
 * @param http          The HTTP client object that the created stream shall be
 *                      related to. Its socket configuration and cookie storage
 *                      will be used.
 *
 * @param method        The HTTP method to use for the requests.
 *
 * @param encoding      The Content-Encoding (content compression method) to use
 *                      for the requests.
 *
 *                      <strong>NOTE:</strong> The stream will NOT automatically
 *                      degrade to identity encoding upon receiving HTTP 415
 *                      status code. It is the responsibility of the higher
 *                      layers to appropriately handle this case.
 *
 *                      <strong>NOTE:</strong> Attemping to use a
 *                      Content-Encoding not compiled into the library will
