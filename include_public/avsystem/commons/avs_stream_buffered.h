/**
 * Creates buffered stream wrapping some previously created underlying stream.
 * Newly created stream can be used to perform buffered reads and writes using
 * underlying stream's read and write functions.
 * If buffers sizes are non-zero, data will be written as chunks of
 * @p out_buffer_size size and read as chunks of @p in_buffer_size size.
 * After use the stream has to be deleted using avs_stream_cleanup(). An
 * underlying stream is deleted automatically.
 *
 * @param *inout_stream   Pointer to an underlying stream which implements at
 *                        least write or read operation. After successful
 *                        return, it will points to an address of newly created
 *                        buffered stream. If NULL, this function returns
 *                        negative value.
 * @param in_buffer_size  Size of input buffer. May be set to 0 if underlying
 *                        stream cannot perform reads or reads can be
 *                        non-buffered. The maximum allowed size is
 *                        SIZE_MAX / 2.
 * @param out_buffer_size Size of output buffer. May be set to 0 if underlying
 *                        stream cannot perform writes or writes can be
 *                        non-buffered. The maximum allowed size is
 *                        SIZE_MAX / 2.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, negative value in case of error. If it fails,
 *         @p inout_stream is not affected and underlying stream should be
 *         deleted manually.
