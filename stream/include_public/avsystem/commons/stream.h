/**
 * @file stream.h
 *
 * Generic stream interface.
 *
 * All functions declared in this file operate on @ref avs_stream_abstract_t
 * which internally stores pointers to the implementations of the interface
 * methods (via @ref avs_stream_v_table_t). You can find sample stream
 * implementations in stream/src folder of the avs_commons source directory.
 *
 * Different kind of streams may have different functionality, and using some
 * methods may not make sense for every stream (for example writing to a
 * read-only stream). In such cases one can safely omit implementation of
 * unnecessary methods. Calling them will result in negative return value.
 *
 * Moreover, the interface may be extended with additional methods by using
 * @ref avs_stream_v_table_extension_t . Again, for sample implementation of
 * this technique see @file stream/src/stream_file.c .
 *
 * Errors are reported via return values of the interface methods. We assume
 * a negative value to indicate an error, and success otherwise. Additionally
 * implementations are allowed to set stream error code (queryable via @ref
 * avs_stream_errno) to provide more information about the occured error.
